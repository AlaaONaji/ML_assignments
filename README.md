# ML_assignments_KNN_and_K_means
one of our volunteered work in microbots team in Damascus university is instructing a machine learning course for Damascus university students.
In our course we are trying to teach our students about git and GitHub using this simple repo to submit thier's assignments, and to fimiliarize their selfs with git version control system and how to use it during the machine learning development process.

## Rules for the students:
- clone the repo and add a directory with your name to work with
- you can use some help from the KNN_and_K_means notebook
- getting your data from Kaggle is a preferred option
- DO NOT PUSH YOUR DATA, ONLY THE NOTEBOOK
